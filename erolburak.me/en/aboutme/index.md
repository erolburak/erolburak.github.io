# HI!

I'm a Senior iOS Developer from Berlin and have been developing apps since 2016. I received my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree from the University of Applied Sciences Hof in the Mobile Computing course. My focus in this course was smartphone and tablet programming. That's how I ended up in the Apple cosmos while I was studying, and I've remained loyal to it ever since.  

I spend my free time with the following hobbies:  

<ul class="ul-content">
	<p>• Motorcycling</p>
	<p>• Skateboarding</p>
	<p>• Snowboarding</p>
	<p>• Visiting concerts</p>
</ul>
